IMPLEMENTATION 1:
By giving id to every seat : 
* 1-150 :  BIG HALL
   * 1-30 Least cost ( 2 front rows)
   * 31-105 Middle cost (5 middle rows)
   * 106 - 150 highest cost ( 3 back rows)
* 151-300 MEDIUM HALL
   * 151-255 Least cost ( 7 front rows)
   * 256 - 300 highest cost ( 3 back rows)
* 301- 450 SMALL HALL
   * 301 - 450 (10 rows)

IMPLEMENTATION 2 :
Hall:
* ID (Primary Key)
* Hall Type
   * Big
   * Medium
   * Small
Then for each Hall type we have seat arrangement
Seat:
* Hall ID (Foreign Key)
* Seat No.  


Doubts:
1. Can we have two primary keys for same table?
2. How can we relate 3 tables in database?
3. How can we create a table with foreign keys (from separate classes) so that they are linked to every other column?
    Example: - While Booking a ticket, we need to store Movie,Time, Show Time, Hall in a single row of a table.
