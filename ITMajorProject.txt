Doubts:
1. Can we have two primary keys for same table?
//2. How can we relate 3 tables in database?
//3. How can we create a table with foreign keys (from separate classes) so that they are linked to every other column?
    Example: - While Booking a ticket, we need to store Movie,Time, Show Time, Hall in a single row of a table.
4. How do we add user functionality?
